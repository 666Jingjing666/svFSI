[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SimVascular/svSolver.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SimVascular/svSolver)

The source code in this repository currently uses an input solver file that is incompatible with the format of the solver file produce by the SimVascular **SV FSI** tool. The SimTK svFSI installers are compatible with the  SimVascular **SV FSI** tool format but use an older version of svFSI.
